(Help)
Source code is in "pacman.py" file.

I also used "py2exe" Module for building a ".exe version" of the game which is stored in "dist" folder.

Saving option uses python pickle files.

You can create your own map file.

Map format description:

  First line: Indicates Size of Console Window. (Width Height)
  
  Second line: Indicates number of walls.
  
  Last line: Indicates number of enemies.
  
  Other lines: Indicates position of walls.
